# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Understanding how to traverse Linux  

**Thoughts:** Having a scrip that informs me of the computer's memory, cpu, 777 files 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Liffe93/bash/blob/main/basicInfo

### Day 1: May 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: webscrapping html code in python

**Thoughts**: I want to automate this more. Where you enter the script name and a url and it can scrape more than the html. However, this is a good spot to start.

### Day 3: May 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Working on portscanning 

**Thoughts** This is important coding skill to fully understand and commit to memory. Port scanning can be used to determine the security posture of a system, find open portts annd services, and identify potenttial targetts for malicous attacks.

**### Day 4: May 22, 2023 **

**Today's Progress**:  Learning how to connect Google Drive API to python to run a webscrapping to Google Sheets script 

**Thoughts** Got the OAUTH 2.0 clientt-secret key downloaded and able to connect drive API to end-point. Was not able to get the main.py from the Corona-websscraping github to work. The issue states: "not found import scripts.sheets as gsheet and covid19_data" 

**Link(s) to work** 
Inspiration is from (https://github.com/binarynightowl/corona_webscraper) 
Needed to understand how to connect drive api to python  üêç  (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python) 
Found a great youtube video to follow: Python Project for Beginners | Browser automation and web scraping craigeslist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9jT2fVqNME) Will ues that tomorrow to scrape data on a musician that needs help creating a database of his music, splits and numbers.
  
 
### Day 5: May 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Researching how to better implement git

**Thoughts** git is a tool to manage CI/CD. Branches are made to contain any edits. Commits are recorded in a log and you can go back to any past iteration whenever + copy it to the master code if something goes wrong. GitHub needs git... yet, it doesn't need github.
