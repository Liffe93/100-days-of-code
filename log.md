# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Understanding how to traverse Linux  

**Thoughts:** Having a scrip that informs me of the computer's memory, cpu, 777 files

### Day 1: May 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: webscrapping html code in python

**Thoughts**: I want to automate this more. Where you enter the script name and a url and it can scrape more than the html. However, this is a good spot to start.

### Day 3: May 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Working on portscanning 

**Thoughts** This is important coding skill to fully understand and commit to memory. Port scanning can be used to determine the security posture of a system, find open portts annd services, and identify potenttial targetts for malicous attacks.
