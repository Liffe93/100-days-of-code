# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Understanding how to traverse Linux  

**Thoughts:** Having a scrip that informs me of the computer's memory, cpu, 777 files 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Liffe93/bash/blob/main/basicInfo

### Day 1: May 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: webscrapping html code in python

**Thoughts**: I want to automate this more. Where you enter the script name and a url and it can scrape more than the html. However, this is a good spot to start.

### Day 3: May 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Working on portscanning 

**Thoughts** This is important coding skill to fully understand and commit to memory. Port scanning can be used to determine the security posture of a system, find open portts annd services, and identify potenttial targetts for malicous attacks.

**### Day 4: May 22, 2023 **

**Today's Progress**:  Learning how to connect Google Drive API to python to run a webscrapping to Google Sheets script 

**Thoughts** Got the OAUTH 2.0 clientt-secret key downloaded and able to connect drive API to end-point. Was not able to get the main.py from the Corona-websscraping github to work. The issue states: "not found import scripts.sheets as gsheet and covid19_data"
